Removed useMaterial3: true - Deprecated in newest update

I wanted to do so much more with this app. I wanted to put repeated code in separate files,
but had issues with putting labels in different class, since we didn't learn that yet,
I wanted to personalise it, I wanted to change the $ to ISK, and other small changes
but I decided to focus on the final assignment, so what you have here is just the code from the class,
without many changes. I will go back to this and make it better in the future, but for now I'm just
doing the bare necessities. Hope that is ok!
